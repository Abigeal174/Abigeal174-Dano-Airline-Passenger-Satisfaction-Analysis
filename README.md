# Dano Airlines Passenger Satisfaction Analysis  

## Project Overview  
This project analyzes over 129,000 passenger survey responses from Dano Airlines to evaluate customer satisfaction and operational efficiency. The analysis was conducted using Power BI to uncover insights into passenger experiences, identify service weaknesses, and propose data-driven recommendations.  

## Key Findings  
- **Satisfaction Rate**: Only 43% of passengers reported being satisfied, while 57% were neutral or dissatisfied.  
- **On-Time Performance**: Just 46% of flights operated without delays, showing delays as a major issue.  
- **Service Ratings**: Overall average rating was 3.24/5, with food, seat comfort, and legroom consistently rated lowest.  
- **Economy Class**: Passengers in economy reported significantly lower satisfaction compared to business and first class.  
- **Business Travelers**: Reported lower satisfaction compared to personal travelers, indicating unmet expectations.  
- **Flight Distance**: Dissatisfaction increased on long-haul flights above 2,000 kilometers.  

## Recommendations  
1. **Improve Operational Performance**: Enhance scheduling efficiency and adopt predictive maintenance to reduce delays.  
2. **Upgrade Economy Experience**: Improve seating comfort, food quality, and in-flight entertainment.  
3. **Focus on Business Travelers**: Offer tailored perks such as priority boarding, lounge access, and reliable Wi-Fi.  
4. **Service Training**: Train staff in customer service, baggage handling, and food delivery, with continuous feedback loops.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Power BI** – data modeling, KPIs, and dashboard creation  
- **DAX** – calculated measures for satisfaction rate, on-time performance, and distance groupings  
- **Excel** – initial data cleaning and preparation  

## Steps in Analysis  
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing in Excel  
2. Creation of KPIs and DAX measures in Power BI  
3. Visualization of service ratings, demographics, travel type, class, and distance groups  
4. Identification of patterns in satisfaction and dissatisfaction  
5. Development of actionable recommendations to improve performance  

## Conclusion  
The analysis reveals that passenger satisfaction at Dano Airlines is critically low, with delays and poor service quality in economy class driving negative experiences. Addressing operational inefficiencies, improving economy services, and enhancing business traveler benefits are key steps to rebuilding passenger trust and raising satisfaction above 50%. This project demonstrates how business intelligence tools can transform raw survey data into insights that directly inform strategic decision-making.
